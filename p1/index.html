                city-state of Singapore has over 8,600 completed high-rises, the majority located in the Downtown Core, the city centre of Singapore.  In the city, there are 94 skyscrapers. The Guoco Tower currently holds the title of tallest building in Singapore. It stands at 290m (951 ft), exempted from the height restriction of 280m in the Central Business District.

                Singapore's history of skyscrapers began with the 1939 completion of the 17-storey Cathay Building. The 70-metre (230 ft) structure was, at the time of its completion, the tallest building in Southeast Asia; it was superseded by the 87-metre (285 ft) Asia Insurance Building in 1954, which remained the tallest in Singapore until the 100 m (328 ft) Shaw Centre was completed in 1958. Singapore went through a major building boom in the 1970s and 1980s that resulted from the city's rapid industrialisation. During this time UOB Plaza became the tallest building in the city-state; the 280 m (919 ft) structure was also the tallest building in the world outside of North America from its 1986 completion until 1989, when the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong was completed. The skyscraper-building boom continued during the 1990s and 2000s, with 30 skyscrapers at least 140 m (459 ft) tall, many of them residential towers, constructed from 1990 through 2008.              </p>

                Mumbai, the commercial and financial capital of India, has the highest number of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings in India. Almost 200 skyscrapers and 4,000 high-rise buildings have already been constructed in Mumbai city. (A skyscraper is defined as a continuously habitable high-rise building that has over 40 floors and is taller than approximately 150 m or 492 ft according to international standards).

                The first skyscrapers in Mumbai were constructed during the 1970s, when Usha Kiran and Matru Mandir were developed and stood at about 76 metres (250 feet), or 25 floors, each. After a significant lull, construction projects since the mid-1990s began taking the skyline upwards, with a major acceleration in the pace of development since 2000, when the Lower Parel area began developing. Palais Royale structurally topped out in 2018 is the tallest building in the country with a height of 320 meters but currently the building is under construction. World One stands at 280.2 metres (919 feet) and 76 floors is the tallest completed building in Mumbai currently.            </p>

                The city of Shanghai, China is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world in terms of skyscraper construction, with the City of Shanghai reporting at the end of 2004 that there had been 6,704 buildings of 11 stories or more completed since 1990. In 2011 there are over 20,000 buildings 11 stories or higher and more than 1,000 buildings exceeding 30 stories in Shanghai. As of January 2019, there are 165 high-rise buildings either under construction, approved for construction, or proposed for construction, of which five are over 300 m (980 ft) high.

                Shanghai's first building boom occurred in the 1920s and 1930s, during the city's heyday as a multinational center of business and finance. The city's international concessions permitted foreign investment, and with it came architectural styles from the West, as seen today in areas such as the French Concession and the Bund. After the Communist takeover in 1949 the city's development was stifled, punished for its earlier capitalist excesses. After economic reforms beginning in the 1980s, the city is undergoing its second construction boom to fulfill its desire to regain its status as an important global financial center.
                
                The tallest skyscraper in Shanghai is the Shanghai Tower, which is 632 m (2,073 ft) tall with 128 floors. It is currently the tallest building in the People's Republic of China and the second tallest in the world.             </p>
